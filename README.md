## Introduction  üìò
In this project, you'll create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if VirtualBox is unavailable) following specific instructions. By the end, you'll be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict guidelines.

## What is a Virtual Machine?  üñ•Ô∏è
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software environment that enables the installation of an operating system within itself, making it appear as if it is running on a physical computer. Virtual machines simulate physical devices such as CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, all powered by the host machine. The hypervisor is responsible for creating and managing VMs by isolating VM resources from the host system.

### Key Concepts:  
- **Host Machine**: The physical device that provides hardware resources for the VM.  üè†üíª
- **Guest Machine**: The virtualized environment running on the host machine.  üéõÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è
- **Hypervisor**: The software managing and isolating VMs from system hardware. üñß

Benefits include running multiple OSs on a single machine, testing unstable programs safely, efficient resource sharing, cost reduction, and easy VM cloning across devices.
-----

## How do Virtual Machines Work?  üñ•Ô∏è
Virtualization enables the sharing of a system's resources among multiple virtual environments. The hypervisor manages resource allocation between the host and guest machines. If a guest requires more resources, the hypervisor ensures the request is handled efficiently.

### Advantages:  
- Run multiple OSs simultaneously on the same machine.  
- Safe environment for testing unstable programs.  
- Improved use of shared resources.  
- Reduced physical infrastructure costs.  
- Easy implementation and cloning of VMs.

## What is LVM?  üì¶üîß
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is an abstraction layer between storage devices and file systems, providing greater flexibility for partition management. LVM allows partition resizing, expansion, and movement across physical disks without worrying about contiguous space.

### Key Concepts:  
- **Physical Volume (PV)**: The actual storage device.  
- **Volume Group (VG)**: A virtual storage pool built from PVs.  
- **Logical Volume (LV)**: The partitions created within VGs, used for file systems, swaps, or VMs.

## What is AppArmor?  üõ°Ô∏èüìú
AppArmor is a security tool that uses Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to restrict what actions processes can perform. For instance, if an application tries to access the camera and the administrator denies this, AppArmor prevents it from doing so.

### Modes:  
- **Enforce Mode**: Prevents restricted actions.  
- **Complain Mode**: Logs restricted actions without blocking them.

## Difference Between Apt and Aptitude  üîç
APT (Advanced Package Tool) and Aptitude are both used for managing packages on Debian-based distributions. APT simplifies package installation and dependency management via command-line tools like `apt-get` and `apt-cache`. Aptitude, a graphical interface, offers better dependency control and allows users to choose between various dependencies.

## How to Use SSH?  üîí
SSH (Secure Shell) enables secure remote administration of servers over the Internet. It uses encryption techniques to ensure that communication between the client and host is secure. 

### SSH Encryption Methods:  
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.  
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public-private key pair.  
- **Hashing**: Provides integrity without decryption.

To connect, use the following command:  
`ssh {username}@{IP_host} -p {port}`

## How to Implement UFW üõ°Ô∏è with SSH üîí
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) simplifies firewall management by offering an interface for configuring iptables. Once installed, UFW can be used to control which ports are open or closed, enhancing security, especially when combined with SSH.

## What is cron and What is wall?  ‚è∞üóìÔ∏è
- **Cron**: A Linux task manager that automates command execution at specified times. For example, scheduling a server restart daily at 4:00 AM.  
- **Wall**: A command used by the root user to broadcast messages to all users logged into the system, useful for notifying of important system changes.

# **System Configuration Commands**

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Install and Configure `sudo`**  
```bash
# Install sudo package
sudo apt install sudo

# Add a user to the sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>

# Verify sudo access
sudo -v
```

---

## üîê **Install and Configure SSH**  
```bash
# Install the SSH server
sudo apt install openssh-server

# Edit configuration to enhance security
# Open /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set:
# - Port 4242
# - PermitRootLogin no

# Check the SSH service status
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Configure UFW (Firewall)**  
```bash
# Install UFW
sudo apt install ufw

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Allow custom SSH port
sudo ufw allow 4242
```

---

## üîí **User and Password Management**  
```bash
# Set password expiration policies
# Edit /etc/login.defs

# Install the PAM quality module for password strength
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality

# Configure password policies in /etc/pam.d/common-password
```

---

## üë• **Create Users and Groups**  
```bash
# Add a new user
sudo adduser <username>

# Create a new group
sudo addgroup <groupname>

# Add a user to a group
sudo adduser <username> <groupname>
```

---

## ‚è∞ **Configure Cron Jobs**  
```bash
# Edit root's crontab file
sudo crontab -u root -e

# Example: Run a script every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * sh /path/to/script
```

8.7 - Configuring Sudoers file, logs, warning message
cd /var/log : Access the location where log files are stored, providing information about system events, services, processes.

Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. To do so, create a folder (name it sudo for clarity), then create a file.log, and save the path to that file.

sudo vim /etc/sudoers or sudo visudo : Access the sudoers file responsible for defining the rules and permissions that determine which users or groups are allowed to execute commands with elevated privileges using the sudo command.

Defaults	badpass_message="Wrong password, please try again!" : Adding warning message ****

Defaults passwd_tries=3 : Sets a default value for the maximum number of password entry attempts allowed when a user runs sudo.

Defaults	logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log" : Sets the location for the sudo log file.

Defaults	log_input, log_output : Enable logging of both input (commands typed by user) and output (result) for sudo commands.

Defaults	requiretty : (teletypewriter) By requiring a TTY, it limits the ability of users to run sudo commands from scripts or automated processes by adding an extra layer of authentication ensuring that users physically present at the console are the ones executing privileged commands.
